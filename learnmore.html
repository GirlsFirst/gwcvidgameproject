                 <p>Lets start by saying that this game is all about strategy..
                 The Game Mafia is a group game where 7 or more people can play. In this game everyone has a role to play.</p>

                <p> There is always a narrator who helps move the game along. The other characters that are involved in the game are "The Townspeople", "The Mafia", and "The Detective".</p>

                 <p> The Mafia wakes up late at night when its told to by the narrator and chooses who he/she will be murdering that night, then goes back to sleep once they have chosen their victim. The Detective also wakes up when its told by the narrator.
                 They decide who they are going to investigate if they have investigated the mafia then the detective has a greater chance of convincing others of who is apart of the mafia.</p>
                 <p>Everybody wakes up in the morning and the narrator now tells them someone has been murdered, and they all gather up and try to convince one another that they are an innocent townsperson.
                 Mafia will play innocent too.</p>
                <p> Once someone has chosen who is the mafia, the people will vote afterwards.
                The accused person will have a chance to try and convince that they are not the mafia.
                 If the Mafia has not been caught then the game still continues until there are more mafias than towns people.</p>
